# C# Coding Projects
During my time with the Tech Academy I centered my studies on the language C#. I ran a lot of assignments that ranged from simple to
complex. Dealing with ASP.NET MVC applications and Entity Framework was my main focus for the majority of the time. These folders contain
some accomplishments from my course.

## Reason
These accomplishments range from a working Blackjack game that deals with a strong understanding of what the language of C# is capable of.
It allows me to cover the functionalities as well as demonstrating use of an object orientied language. You will see a demonstration of
Entity Framework in my Car Insurance web application, that also deals with a database first approach to Entity Framework.
